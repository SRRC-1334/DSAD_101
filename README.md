# DSAD_101
Learning the below Data Structures And Algorithms Design topics.

This is a part of Semester 1 course of M.Tech (Data Science & Engineering) at BITS-WILP, Pilani.

The course covers design, implementation and applications of basic and advanced data structures including trees, graphs, bloom filters.
The course also covers algorithm design techniques like greedy, dynamic, map reduce etc. using examples from sorting, searching, graph theory, networking and number theory. 
The complexity issues are also discussed further.
